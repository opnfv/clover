Perhaps, there\u0027s a way to execute prerequisite build script prior to the Docker build but I\u0027m not sure how to have another script, like your build.sh script, get executed prior to the Dockerfile build being executed with the releng framework. If there isn\u0027t a provision for this, we might consider checking in the binary for now.",
