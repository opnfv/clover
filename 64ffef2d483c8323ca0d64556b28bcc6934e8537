The same yaml is also included in the SDC deployment yaml\n\nclover-controller and clover-collector (in clover-system) both use redis (currently in default) and we have snort-ids writing alerts to redis (in default). This is an example of a service that will need to be used by services in clover-system and also potentially by our sample services that might be in other namespaces.",
